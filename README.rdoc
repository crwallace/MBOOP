== README

This app keeps track of physical items as they move through a group of people. While initially designed for folders, you can easily repurpose it for other physical items too.

A simple USB scanner, with autofocus set to true, makes this Web app work without installing any firmware/software.

You will need to install and configure the Devise, CanCan, and Barby gems to make this work. It runs well on Heroku.
