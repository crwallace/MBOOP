This app keeps track of physical items as they move through a group of people. While initially designed for folders, you can easily repurpose it for other physical items too.

A simple USB scanner, with autofocus set to true, makes this Web app work without installing any firmware/software.

To remove a user:

Update the User.active to false, e.g.

@b = User.find(23)
@b.active = false
@b.save
